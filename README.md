# Would You Rather Project

This project implements the Would You Rather project per Udacity rubric.

The appearance of the app is somewhat crude, since I decided to focus on the react/redux part of the project and not worry about the appearance.

It includes a login page (other pages show 404 until user is logged in). Once you are logged in, you can access the leaderboard, a new question page and individual polls.

To start the app, download to a folder and follow the below:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
